# 🌊 Ash Greninja (Battle Bond Form)

Ash Greninja is a special alternate form of Greninja, recognizable by the **dark pattern on its head**.  
Unlike normal evolutions, this form requires a mix of **friendship**, a **special cap item**, and the **Water Shuriken**.

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Step 1 — Build Friendship

Before unlocking the form, you must raise Greninja’s **friendship level** with its trainer.  
Make sure to battle together, walk, and avoid fainting to increase its bond.

---

## 🎩 Step 2 — Unlock Battle Bond

Once Greninja’s friendship is high enough, use the item:  

- **Ash Cap** (`mega_showdown:ash_cap`)  

➡️ Right-click Greninja while holding the Ash Cap.  
This unlocks the **Battle Bond ability**, preparing Greninja for its transformation.

---

## 💧 Step 3 — Water Shuriken Transformation

With Battle Bond active, craft and use the **Water Shuriken** to achieve the **true Ash Greninja form** (with the black head pattern).  

### 🔧 Crafting the Water Shuriken

Use a **Smithing Table** with:

- 🌀 **Tide Armor Trim Smithing Template**  
- 💧 **Water Gem**  
- 💠 **Mega Stone Crystal**

## 🎯 How to Transform

1. Ensure Greninja has **Battle Bond** unlocked.  
2. Hold the **Water Shuriken**.  
3. Right-click Greninja → it transforms into **Ash Greninja** with its iconic black markings.  

➡️ The transformation is cosmetic and does not change Greninja’s typing or base stats.

---

## 📌 Notes

- This process is **exclusive to Cobblemon Realms**.  
- The transformation is **cosmetic** (visual only), but perfect for showing off your bond with Greninja.  
- Removing Battle Bond (by evolving or replacing Greninja) reverts it to a normal Greninja.

---

## ✅ Summary

- Raise **friendship** with Greninja.  
- Use the **Ash Cap** to unlock **Battle Bond**.  
- Craft and use the **Water Shuriken** to activate the **Ash Greninja form**.  

Your Greninja will now bear the **black head markings** of Ash’s legendary companion!
