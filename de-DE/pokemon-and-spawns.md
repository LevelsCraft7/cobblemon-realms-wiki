# Pokémon and Spawns

Cobblemon Realms features a **customized spawn system**, carefully tuned to provide immersive and biome-sensitive encounters. Whether you're searching for rare species or trying to build your dream team, understanding how spawns work will help you tremendously.

---

## 📍 Biome-based spawns

Different Pokémon appear depending on the biome and time of day:

- Forest → Grass-type Pokémon
- Oceans → Water-types
- Deserts → Fire-types
- ⛰️ Mountains & Caves → Rock-types, Steel-types, Dragon-types
- 🧪 Swamps → Poison-types
- 🌌 End & Nether zones → Ultra-rare and special forms

Some rare Pokémon may only spawn during specific times or conditions.

---

## 🕓 Spawn intervals

Spawns are configured to be dynamic and feel natural.

- Some Pokémon only spawn **at night**, **during specific moon phases**, or under **certain weather**.
- Legendary and Mythical Pokémon may require **special triggers** or **items** to appear.
- Underground spawns (e.g., cave-exclusive Pokémon) are handled via custom logic.

## 🗺️ Using `/checkspawns`

This command allows you to see which Pokémon can spawn in your current biome.

```bash
Cobblemon Realms uses custom spawn logic and configurations.
```

This is ideal for understanding your surroundings and tracking rare spawns on the go.

## 🤖 Discord Bot Integration – Check Spawns Remotely!

Our Discord server offers a powerful integration via the **@Our Story** bot. You can use it to check where a specific Pokémon spawns — across all dimensions and biomes — without needing to be in-game!

### 📋 Available Commands:

- 🇬🇧 English:
  `/where <pokemon_name>`
- 🇫🇷 Français :
  `/tesou <pokemon_name>`
- 🇩🇪 Deutsch:
  `/wobistdu <pokemon_name>`
- 🇯🇵 Japanese (Romaji):
  `/doko <pokemon_name>`

You’ll receive a detailed result with all known spawn biomes for that species.
Some commun Pokémon may return a list of **100+ possible biomes**.

> 💡 Use this feature to **plan your adventure** or optimize shiny/rare hunts.
