## FAQs

### Q: Does Eevee evolve into Evereon by fighting only wild Eeveelutions, or can Trainer Battles be used? Does Eevee have to fight them, or can I use any Pokémon?

A: Some players report that Trainer Battles work while others say they don’t. I’ve tested it myself and it didn’t work, but there might be a setup issue. I recommend trying both methods. Note that Eevee must land the finishing blow on all 18 Eeveelutions from the base mod and addon.

### Q: I can’t see the Eeveelutions in the Pokédex?

A: They have their own dedicated section in the Regions.

### Q: What flying-type move can Eevee learn?

A: In the datapack, I added Mirror Move, which Eevee can learn at Level 20.
