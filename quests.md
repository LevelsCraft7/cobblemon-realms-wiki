# 📖 Quests

The full quest documentation is currently being expanded.

Cobblemon Realms includes structured progression through custom questlines designed to:

* Guide new players
* Introduce core systems gradually
* Unlock mechanics naturally
* Provide long term objectives

Quests are an essential part of the experience and are highly recommended, especially for new players.
