## ➕ "Can I add more mods?"

- Yes, but do so carefully:
  - Some mods can break **performance**, **game balance**, or **quest logic**.
  - Avoid mods that overwrite Cobblemon or FTB systems.
  - Test in singleplayer before adding to a server.

## 👥 "Can I start solo and invite friends later?"

- Absolutely! Cobblemon Realms supports solo play.
- Later, copy your **world save** into a server to continue with friends.

## 🧃 "Can I host my server on Aternos / Minehut / free hosts?"

- ❌ Not recommended.  
  These platforms **lack power and customization** for large modpacks.
- Choose a host with at least **4GB RAM**, Java 21, and FTP access.
- We recommend **BisectHosting** — optimized for this modpack.

## ⚙️ "Does the modpack require special setup?"

- Yes. Minimum setup:
  - **Java 21** (or higher)
  - At least **8 GB RAM**
- Avoid Java 8, Java 17, or other outdated runtimes — they will crash.
- Dedicated GPU is strongly recommended for shader performance.
