## 📊 Pokémon Level Cap
Your Pokémon cannot exceed the level cap shown on your Trainer Card. (LVL 50 at the start)
Once a Pokémon reaches this cap, it stops gaining experience until you progress further.
Trainers will refuse to battle you if any Pokémon in your party are above the level cap.
To increase your level cap, defeat the Key Trainers listed on your Trainer Card.
Track your progress using in-game advancements and your Trainer Card.

## 🔍 Finding Key Trainers
Key Trainers spawn in specific biomes—consult your Trainer Card for their locations.
Having a Pokémon at the level cap in your party increases the spawn rate of Key Trainers.
Defeating new trainers reduces the likelihood of previously defeated ones respawning.
Your Trainer Card will glow and display a tracking arrow when a Key Trainer is nearby.

## 🏆 Unlocking Gym Leaders
To unlock Gym Leaders, you must defeat a certain number of trainers.
The mod’s advancements tab provides hints and guidance on how to progress toward unlocking them.

## 🤝 Trainer Association
Occasionally, a villager known as the Trainer Association may spawn.
This NPC offers you a choice between different battle series:
Brilliant Diamond / Shining Pearl (Difficulty: 2.5/5)
Radical Red (Difficulty: 4.5/5)
And more...
Your Trainer Card will display an arrow above it when the Trainer Association NPC is nearby, helping you locate them easily.

## 💡 Tips
Train multiple Pokémon to avoid reaching the level cap too quickly.
Engage in battles with trainers early to maintain steady progression and avoid being held back later.
Regularly check the advancements tab in-game for clues about your next objective.
