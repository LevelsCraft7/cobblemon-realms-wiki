# 🧗 Trainer Progression Overview

In **Cobblemon Realms**, trainer battles aren’t just random encounters — they’re part of a **structured progression system** driven by **Trainer Cards**, **Key Trainers**, and **Trainer Series**.  
This system encourages **exploration**, **tactical planning**, and a steady climb through increasingly difficult challenges.

## 📊 Level Cap System

Each player has a **personal level cap**, starting at **level 25** in this modpack (default in the base mod is lower).

### ⚙️ Effects of the Level Cap
- 🛑 Pokémon **at or above** your cap **cannot gain experience**.
- 🚫 Trainers will **refuse to battle** if any Pokémon in your party is over the cap.
- 🎯 The **strength of nearby trainers** scales to your team but **never exceeds your cap**.

### 🧭 Raising Your Cap
To increase your level cap:
- Defeat **Key Trainers** in the specific order defined by the progression system.
- Your **Trainer Card** shows your next Key Trainer and provides hints on where to find them.
- The **Advancements tab** offers additional milestones and clues.

## 🔍 Key Trainers & Tracking

Key Trainers are the main progression checkpoints — defeating them raises your level cap and unlocks tougher challenges.

### 🧭 Tracking System Behavior
- **At the start of the game**, once you obtain a **Trainer Card** but **have no active trainer series**, a **holographic arrow** will appear.  
  → This arrow **always points toward the Trainer Association NPC** so you can start your first series.
- After you select a series, **the arrow disappears** — there is **no arrow toward Key Trainers** themselves.
- From this point, you must **use the Trainer Card information** to locate your Key Trainers:
  - **Biome names**
  - **Special conditions**
  - **Sometimes required items** to summon them

### 🌍 Finding Key Trainers in Cobblemon Realms
In **Cobblemon Realms**, extra tools are provided through the quest system:
- Each quest category lists **all trainers in a series**.
- You can **exchange Realms Coins** to instantly spawn a trainer you need to fight **directly on you**.
  - Trainers can be spawned infinitely this way.
  - **Cooldown:** once defeated, a trainer cannot be fought again until **one Minecraft day** (≈ 20 minutes IRL) has passed.
- Quests have an **Info Button**:
  - Allows you to **activate a series remotely**  
    *(You can only have one active series at a time — activating a new one resets progress on the current series unless it’s completed).*
  - Provides a link to a **progression graph** showing the trainer order and their **average levels**.
  - Points to relevant **Advancements** so you can track series order directly in Minecraft.

## 🏆 Unlocking Gym Leaders & Major Trainers

Advancing isn’t just about cap increases — it also opens the door to **Gym Leaders, Rivals, Elite Four, villain teams**, and other major challenges.

**Unlock conditions:**
- 🥇 Beat the required **Key Trainers** in a series to unlock its high-tier opponents.
- 💠 Some require **special items** (e.g., *Hard Stone*) to summon.
- 🧱 Use a **Trainer Spawner** (found in villages or arenas) and right-click it with the item to spawn the trainer after a short delay.
- 🧩 Advanced content (Leagues, Elite Four, team bosses) may require multiple series completions.

> **Tip:** Your progression is **non-linear** — you can focus on one path or mix multiple series.

---

## 🤝 Trainer Association

The **Trainer Association** is a special NPC that helps you start a new series.

- **Spawns near a player** who:
  - Has a **Trainer Card** in inventory, **and**
  - Has **no active trainer series** in progress.
- When close to it, your Trainer Card will:
  - **Glow**
  - Show an **arrow** pointing toward the NPC
- The NPC offers a **menu of series**, each with unique themes, progression paths, and difficulty.
