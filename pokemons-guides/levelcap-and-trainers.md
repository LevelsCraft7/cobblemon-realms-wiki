# 🧗 Trainer Progression Overview

Cobblemon Realms introduces a structured progression system based on **Trainer Cards**, **Key Trainers**, and **Trainer Series**. This system encourages exploration, tactical planning, and steady advancement through increasingly difficult challenges.

---

## 📊 Level Cap System

Each player has their own **personal level cap**, starting at **level 50** (unless your first Key Trainer is of a higher level).

### ⚙️ Effects of the Level Cap

- 🛑 Pokémon at or above your level cap **cannot gain experience**.
- 🚫 Trainers will **refuse to battle** you if any Pokémon in your party exceeds your current cap.
- 🎯 The **difficulty of nearby trainers** scales to your team, but never surpasses your level cap.

### 🧭 Increasing Your Cap

To raise your level cap, you must defeat **Key Trainers** in a defined order.  
Check your **Trainer Card** and **Advancements tab** to follow your progress and upcoming milestones.

---

## 🔍 Key Trainers & Tracking

Key Trainers are essential to your progression — defeating them unlocks level cap increases and access to higher-tier content.

- 🌍 **Spawn Locations**: Found in specific biomes shown on your Trainer Card.
- 🧭 **Tracking System**:
  - The card **glows** when a Key Trainer is active.
  - A **holographic arrow** points to the trainer's location.
  - If the trainer is in another dimension, the arrow **spins randomly**.
- 🔄 **Order Matters**: Key Trainers must be defeated in the correct sequence.
- 🎯 **Spawn Boost**: Having a Pokémon at your cap increases Key Trainer spawn rate.
- 🧠 **Persistence**: Trainers you've already beaten are less likely to respawn.

## 🏆 Unlocking Gym Leaders

Gym Leaders and higher challenges are unlocked by progressing through Key Trainer victories.

- 🥇 Defeat a **required number** of Key Trainers from a series to unlock its Gym Leader.
- 🧩 Some advanced challenges (League, Team Bosses) require **multiple completions** or defeating entire chains.
- 📈 Use the **Trainer Card** and **Advancements tab** to monitor your path.

Progress is **non-linear** — discover, battle, and unlock in the order that suits your journey!

## 🤝 Trainer Association

The **Trainer Association** is a special villager NPC that appears to guide players into their first challenge series.

- 🧭 It will **spawn near a player** who:
  - Has a **Trainer Card** (either in hand or inventory), **and**
  - **Has no current trainer series** in progress.
  
- 🗺️ When nearby, your Trainer Card will:
  - **Glow**, and  
  - Display a **guiding arrow** pointing toward the Trainer Association.

This NPC offers access to a wide range of **trainer series**, each with its own theme, progression tree, and difficulty level. It’s your gateway to structured challenges in Cobblemon Realms.
