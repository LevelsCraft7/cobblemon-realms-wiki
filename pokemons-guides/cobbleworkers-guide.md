# 📘 CobbleWorkers Guide

CobbleWorkers is a **utility mod** for Cobblemon that allows certain Pokémon to automatically perform useful tasks in your Minecraft world. Instead of just battling, your Pokémon can now act as **helpers** for farming, gathering, generating resources, and more.

This makes your Pokémon team not only essential for combat but also a vital part of your **base automation**.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

* Place your Pokémon in the world as a **CobbleWorker**.
* Each Pokémon has a **job role** depending on its typing or species.
* Workers will automatically perform their job in a radius around them (configurable in `cobbleworkers.json`).
* Some roles require **cooldowns** (e.g., generating water/lava).

## 🌱 Default vs Custom Config

By default, almost every role was handled by **Pikachu**, with just a few exceptions (Combee for honey, Chansey for healing, etc.).

In this pack, we use a **customized config** where different Pokémon fulfill jobs more logically according to their **type and lore**.
Pikachu is still included in important roles (Honey collecting + Healing), but other Pokémon now have unique utility.
