Welcome to **Cobblemon Realms**.
This modpack is designed around progression, exploration, custom systems, and long-term adventure.

Here is what you should do when launching the modpack for the first time.

---

## 1. Create your world properly

* Make sure you are using the official version of the modpack.
* Do not add extra mods before your first launch.
* Let the game finish generating data and loading datapacks.

If something seems broken on first load, restart the game once before troubleshooting further.

---

## 2. Choose your starter Pokémon

You will be prompted to select your starter.

Your choice matters early game, so consider:

* Type advantages
* Your preferred playstyle
* The biome you plan to explore first

After selecting your starter, your adventure officially begins.

---

## 3. Open the Quest Book

Cobblemon Realms is built around structured progression.

Open your **Quest Book** immediately after spawning.
It will:

* Guide your early survival
* Introduce core mechanics
* Explain custom systems
* Provide structured objectives

The questlines are designed to prevent confusion and give direction.

---

## 4. Explore the World

World generation includes multiple biome and structure expansions.

You are encouraged to:

* Explore different biome types
* Discover custom structures
* Search for rare spawn conditions
* Locate strategic base locations

Certain Pokémon only spawn under specific biome, time, or environmental conditions.

Exploration is not optional. It is part of progression.

---

## 5. Train and Catch Pokémon

Catching and training Pokémon is central to progression.

* Use crafted Poké Balls
* Learn spawn patterns
* Train your team strategically
* Prepare for tougher encounters and raids

Some systems, events, and challenges are balanced around team strength.

---

## 6. Understand the Custom Systems

Cobblemon Realms includes custom systems that expand beyond default Cobblemon gameplay.

Depending on your version, this may include:

* Custom economy elements
* Realms Coins integration
* Custom progression adjustments
* Additional mechanics tied to quests

These systems are explained gradually through quests and documentation.

---

## 7. Multiplayer Recommended

While fully playable in singleplayer, the experience is enhanced in multiplayer.

Multiplayer enables:

* Trading
* Raids
* Economy interactions
* Community events

If you join the official server, follow its specific rules and setup instructions.

---

## 8. Keep Your Game Stable

For the best experience:

* Do not modify the modpack unless you understand the consequences.
* Avoid removing core mods.
* Always back up your world before updating.

If issues occur after modifying the pack, revert to the official version before seeking support.
