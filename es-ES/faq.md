- Use `/checkspawns` to verify what appears in your area

## ❓ "Can I add more mods?"

- Yes, but be cautious: some mods may break balance or compatibility.

## ❓ "Can I play singleplayer and invite friends later?"

- Yes! You can **turn your world into a server** later by copying the world save to your server folder.

## ❓ "Can I use aternos/minehut/free hosts?"

- Not recommended for big modpacks like Cobblemon Realms. Too many limitations.

## ❓ "Does the modpack require special setup?"
