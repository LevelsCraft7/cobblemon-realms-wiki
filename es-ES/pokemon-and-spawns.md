# Pokémon and Spawns

Cobblemon Realms uses custom spawn logic and configurations.

## 📍 Biome-based spawns

Different Pokémon appear depending on the biome and time of day:

- Forest → Grass-type Pokémon
- Oceans → Water-types
- Deserts → Fire-types

## 🕓 Spawn intervals

Spawns are configured to be dynamic and feel natural. Some rare Pokémon may only spawn during specific times or conditions.

## 🗺️ Using `/checkspawns`

This command allows you to see which Pokémon can spawn in your current biome.
