# Guía de instalación

This guide explains how to install Cobblemon Realms for both solo and multiplayer play.

## 🖥️ Singleplayer (Client Installation)

We recommend using CurseForge:

1. Open the CurseForge [app](https://www.curseforge.com/download/app).

3. Click install and launch the modpack.

> Make sure Java 21 is installed!

## 🎮  How to Open a Minecraft Server to Play with Friends

_For Cobblemon Realms & Our Story Modpacks_

## 🖥️ OPTION 1 – Host the server on your own PC _(Free but needs a good setup)_

You can use the **official Server Pack** I provide with each update of the modpack!

⚠️ **Requirements:**

- At least **8GB of free RAM** (16GB total is ideal)
- **Java 21** (required for Cobblemon Realms!)
- A stable internet connection
- Basic understanding of running `.bat` files
- Port forwarding if your friends play from outside your home network

---

### 📦 Step-by-step Setup Guide (included in the Server Pack)

**🛠️ Step 1: Configure RAM (Optional, but recommended)**
Open the file `user_jvm_args.txt` and edit the memory values:
-Xmx8G -Xms8G

- `Xmx` = Max RAM
- `Xms` = Min RAM\
   ➡️ _Don’t allocate all your RAM! Leave at least 2-4GB for your system._

---

**📜 Step 2: First Server Launch & Accepting the EULA**

1. Extract the server pack `.zip` to a folder (ex: `CobblemonServer`)
2. Run the `run.bat` file (double-click it)
3. It will stop and create a file called `eula.txt`
4. Open it and change:\
   `eula=false` → `eula=true`
5. Save and close

---

🔄 **Step 3: Launch the Server Again**

- Run `run.bat` again
- The server will now fully start
- Wait for the world to generate
- You’re good to go!

🌍 You can now:

- **Play locally** by connecting to `localhost`
- **Invite friends** on the same Wi-Fi via your local IP
- Or **configure port forwarding** for online friends

---

## 🌐 OPTION 2 – Use a Game Server Host (Recommended)

If you don’t want to deal with technical setup, I recommend using a hosting service!

🟢 I'm partnered with **Bisect Hosting**, and you can install **Cobblemon Realms in 1 click** via their panel.

✅ **What you get:**

- Java 21 ready
- Modpack pre-installed
- Server always online
- Easy management panel
- Better connection for players across the world
