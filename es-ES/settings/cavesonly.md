# üõ°Ô∏è Disabling Hostile Mobs Restriction to Caves

In the **Cobblemon Realms** modpack, hostile mobs are restricted to caves thanks to the **In Control!** mod.\
If you want to completely disable hostile mob restrictions, simply remove this mod.

## üîß Steps

1. Open the `mods` folder in your Cobblemon Realms installation.
2. Delete the `InControl` mod file (typically named `InControl-*.jar`).
3. Restart the game.

After removing the mod, hostile mobs will no longer be restricted to caves and will spawn according to Minecraft‚Äôs default behavior.
