# 🧭 Pokémon and Spawns

Cobblemon Realms features a **custom spawn system** designed to make exploration meaningful and rewarding.

Pokémon do not spawn randomly everywhere.
Where you are, when you are there, and what conditions are active all matter.

## 🌍 Where Pokémon Spawn

Spawns depend mainly on:

* 🌎 **Biome**
* 🌙 **Time of day**
* 🌧 **Weather**
* 🕳 **Surface or underground**
* 🌌 **Dimension** (Overworld, Nether, End, Aether, DeeperDarker)

For example:

* Forest areas tend to host Grass and Bug types
* Mountains and caves favor Rock, Steel, and Dragon types
* Oceans and beaches feature Water types
* Deserts host Ground and Fire types
* Some species are exclusive to the Nether or End

Many Pokémon use **biome groups**, meaning they can appear in multiple similar biomes, not just one exact location.

This encourages exploration instead of staying in one place.

## ⭐ Rarity Matters

Each Pokémon belongs to a rarity tier:

* Common
* Uncommon
* Rare
* Ultra Rare

Rare Pokémon may:

* Have very low spawn chances
* Only appear at night
* Only spawn underground
* Require specific weather

If something feels difficult to find, it is often intentional.

## 📡 Tools to Help You

You are not expected to guess everything.

---

### 🛰️ PokeNav

The **PokeNav** item allows you to:

* See what Pokémon can spawn around you
* Check local spawn pools in real time
* Plan hunts efficiently

If you are exploring a new biome, use it.

---

### 🎣 FishingNav

The **FishingNav** focuses on:

* Water based encounters
* Fishing specific Pokémon
* Biome dependent aquatic spawns

Very useful when targeting rare water types.

---

### 🔎 `/checkspawns`

You can type:

```
/checkspawns
```

This command shows what Pokémon are eligible to spawn **in your current location**.

If nothing interesting appears, try changing biome, time, or weather.

---

## 🤖 Discord Spawn Bot

You can also check spawns without launching the game.

On the official Discord, inside:

`#❓・cr-checkspawn`

Use the bot **@Cobblemon Realms#8967**

Commands:

🇬🇧 `/where <pokemon_name>`
🇫🇷 `/tesou <pokemon_name>`
🇩🇪 `/wobistdu <pokemon_name>`
🇯🇵 `/doko <pokemon_name>`

The bot returns spawn information including biome and condition requirements.

Perfect for planning hunts in advance.

## 🧠 Beginner Advice

If you cannot find a Pokémon:

1. Check the biome
2. Check if it is day or night
3. Try underground
4. Check weather
5. Use PokeNav or `/checkspawns`

Exploration is part of progression.
Moving to a new biome often changes everything.

If you believe a spawn is not working correctly, join the Discord and report it with:

* Pokémon name
* Biome
* Time of day
* Dimension

The more precise your report, the faster it can be verified.
