# 🧭 Pokémon and Spawns

Cobblemon Realms features a **customized spawn system**, carefully tuned to provide immersive and biome-sensitive encounters. Whether you're searching for rare species or trying to build your dream team, understanding how spawns work will help you tremendously.

## 📍 Biome-Based Spawns

Different Pokémon appear depending on the **biome**, **time of day**, and other conditions:

- 🌲 Forests → Grass-types, Bug-types
- 🌊 Oceans & Beaches → Water-types, Electric-types (during storms)
- 🏜️ Deserts → Fire-types, Ground-types
- ⛰️ Mountains & Caves → Rock-types, Steel-types, Dragon-types
- 🧪 Swamps → Poison-types
- 🌌 End & Nether zones → Ultra-rare and special forms

Some Pokémon are **extremely rare** and may only spawn in one biome under specific conditions (e.g., weather, dimension, time).

---

## 🕓 Spawn Timing and Behavior

Spawns are dynamically configured to feel **natural**:

- Some Pokémon only spawn **at night**, **during specific moon phases**, or under **certain weather**.
- Legendary and Mythical Pokémon may require **special triggers** or **items** to appear.
- Underground spawns (e.g., cave-exclusive Pokémon) are handled via custom logic.

## 🔎 Using `/checkspawns` In-Game

Use this command to instantly check what Pokémon can appear **in your current biome**:

```bash
/checkspawns
````

This is ideal for understanding your surroundings and tracking rare spawns on the go.

## 🤖 Discord Bot Integration – Check Spawns Remotely!

Our Discord server offers a powerful integration via the **@Our Story** bot. You can use it to check where a specific Pokémon spawns — across all dimensions and biomes — without needing to be in-game!

### 📋 Available Commands:

* 🇬🇧 English:
  `/where <pokemon_name>`
* 🇫🇷 Français :
  `/tesou <pokemon_name>`
* 🇩🇪 Deutsch:
  `/wobistdu <pokemon_name>`
* 🇯🇵 Japanese (Romaji):
  `/doko <pokemon_name>`

You’ll receive a detailed result with all known spawn biomes for that species.
Some commun Pokémon may return a list of **100+ possible biomes**.

> 💡 Use this feature to **plan your adventure** or optimize shiny/rare hunts.
